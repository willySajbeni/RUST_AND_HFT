 🦀 How Rust and High-Frequency Trading strategies detect inefficiencies in the currency market.

In FX, milliseconds can create profitable opportunities.
This post breaks down the math behind currency arbitrage — and simulates it using pure Rust (no external crates, just threads and channels).
Threads are a way to run different parts of your code at the same time.
It’s like having multiple waiters working together instead of just one doing everything.

Here’s the logic traders use to act faster than the market itself:
📉 What Is Currency Arbitrage?
Let’s consider a realistic example:
Spot Dollar (cash market): R$5.00
Futures Dollar (near maturity): R$5.05
This 5-cent difference can be caused by:
interest rates;
liquidity imbalances;
latency;
asymmetric market reactions.

🔁 An HFT system would:
Buy in the cheaper market (R$5.00 spot)
Sell in the more expensive one (R$5.05 futures)
Profit = price difference – operational costs
💸 With a $100,000 contract, that's R$4,000 profit — possibly in milliseconds.
